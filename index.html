				<p>The purpose of this documentation is to provide you with the information and resources you'll need to release your products on Steam, one of the leading entertainment platforms worldwide.</p>

				<p>In this section, you'll find information about becoming a Steamworks partner. Steamworks is a set of tools that enable you to distribute your product to Steam customers and a set of features you can use in your product, such as matchmaking, leaderboards, Steam Workshop, etc. The Steamworks partner portal is where you'll be able to manage each of your products, and your account and company information.
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Set Up Steamworks Account</li>
					<p>The first step in getting started is to sign up to become a Steamworks partner.</p>

					<p>Once you have set up your account and your bank, tax and company information has been verified, you can add more users and start to set up your first product, or "Application".</p>

					<li>Download the Steamworks SDK</li>
					<p>Once you have completed the onboarding process, you'll need to download the Steamworks SDK, which contains all the scripts and templates for building and uploading your product to Steam.</p>
					<p>You can download the latest version of the Steamworks SDK here and can learn more about the SDK in the Steamworks SDK documentation.</p>

					<li>Create your Steam build & depots</li>
					<p>To get your application up and running on Steam, you'll need to upload a build and configure a few settings. This process is outlined in detail in Uploading to Steam. When you want to building and test your application is up to you.</p>

					<li>Configure Steamworks features</li>
					<p>You are free to use as few or as many of Steamworks features as you like. For more information, see Features.</p>

					<li>Creating your store page & pricing</li>
					<p>While you're working on getting your application up and running, you can also be preparing the store presence for your game or software. If you have any questions during the process, you can ask questions or search for help in the Store Page/Marketing forums. For more information see Store Presence.</p>

					<li>Preparing for Release</li>
					<p>Most of the work to prepare your product for release on Steam can be done yourself through the tools and documentation. But once you get close to releasing, Valve will need to review your store page, proposed pricing, and game build.</p>
					<p>For a more detailed description, please see Review Process.</p>

				<p>This section provides an in depth look into what goes into managing your Steam store presence.</p>
				<p>Some of the topics included include:</p>
				<table id="table1" border="1">
					<tr>
						<td>Applications</td>
						<td>An Application (or App) is the main representation of a product on Steam. An App generally has its own store page, it's own Community Hub, and is what appears in customers' libraries.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Coming Soon</td>
						<td>You can put up a Coming Soon page for your product well in advance of your release date. This way, you can let customers know the title is coming to Steam and start building an audience and excitement around your product.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Early Access</td>
						<td>Steam Early Access enables you to sell your game on Steam while it is still being developed, and provide context to customers that a product should be considered "unfinished." Early Access is a place for games that are in a playable alpha or beta state, are worth the current value of the playable build, and that you plan to continue to develop for release.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Editing A Store Page</td>
						<td>This documentation will provide information on how to prepare your store page before release and update your store page after release</td>
					</tr>
